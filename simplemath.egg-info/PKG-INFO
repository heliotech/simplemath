`simplemath` -- project for learning 4 basic algebraic operations with python
=============================================================================

`simplemath` project presents the visualization of 4 basic algebraic operations. With help of the ascii or UTF characters it assists younger children in learning how to calculate and how to use the python programming language.

The project was build to learn how to:

1. build python packages and upload them them to PyPI,
2. use GitHub.

.. !TODO: set the number of versions: 3 or 4.

Contents
--------

1. `simplemath.py`

The file `simplemath.py` contains 4 functions, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, which illustrate basic arithmetical operation, respectivey addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. All the functions represent provided arguments with simple dots, which can be counted, by children, to check their understanding of an operation. The functions are designed for positive, integer arguments and results. Each function can be used in an interactive pyhon session, or `simple_examples.py` can be run to show all the functions in action.

`sub`, `mul` and `div` functions use python fstrings, while `add` applies only simple concatenation. This approach shows better visual effect of the former solution.

WARNING! `simplemath.py` has no error handling, except for `div`, and should be used with caution.

(`printEval` function was designed to facilitate printing a piece of code, which would be followed by the execution of said code.)

2. `fancymath.py`

`fancymath.py` implements the same basic functions, `add`, `sub`, `mul` and `div`, with better capabilities for representing the algebraic operations. Markers in a graphical representation of the number are grouped into parts, while printing the parts are separated, for readability. Either the marker, group length and separator can be defined, as parameters.

The functions are designed for positive integers, although they are provided with basic error handling.
